<!-- Introduction (All About Me)-->
<p>
My vibrant soul was born on June 4, 2001, in the enchanting land of Georgetown, Guyana. At the tender age of three, I embarked on a life-altering journey, immigrating to a new world when I was just three, leaving behind the familiar rhythms of home. I was sandwiched between a little brother, who's five years my junior, and an older sister, seven years my senior—our house was always buzzing with dreams and laughter. An artistic spirit bloomed early in me, finding solace and joy in the strokes of my paintbrush, particularly when crafting captivating portraits. Fueling my insatiable curiosity, I embraced the thrill of experimentation, relishing the challenge of trying new things. Orange hues swirled into the canvas of my life as her favorite color, and I'm currently reveling in her "My Pink Girl era," a phase marked by self-discovery and self-development.
